# Lecture Notes Quick Start Guide
* This is a `Quick Start` guide showcases how to  create a `lecture notes` document.
  * I have written this based on [Chapter 5](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/booleans-and-conditionals/index.html)
* Things to be aware of:
  * Bullets are meant for notes
  * Key terms should be encapsulated in backticks:
    * **Example:** `key term`
  * Code Blocks should be encapsulated within 6 `backticks`
    * Be sure that you declare the language the code block should be rendering
```C#
// main.cs - It is also a great idea to reference the this code snippet is coming from

bool cool = true
```


# Chapter 5: Making Decisions With Conditionals
## Booleans
* H2s are the subsections of the Chapter
  * They are normally denoted by the chapter number and then a demonical point
    * ie: `5.1 Booleans`

### Booleans Values
* H3s are subsections of the overarching section
  * They are normally denoted by the chapter number and then two demonical points
    * ie: `5.1.1 Booleans Values`

### Boolean Conversion
### Booleans Expressions
#### Comparison Operators
* H4s are subsections of the H3 section
* They are normally denoted by the chapter number and then three demonical points
    * ie: `5.1.3.1 Comparison Operators`

## Logical Operators

### Boolean Operators
#### Logical AND
#### Logical OR
#### Logical NOT
### Operator Precedence
### Truth Tables

## Conditionals
### if Statements
### else Clauses
### else if Statements

## Nested Conditionals

## Whats Next
1. First, student will need to complete (In this order):
   1. [Exercises: Booleans and Conditionals](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/booleans-and-conditionals/exercises.html)
   2. [Studio: Goal Setting and Getting into the Right Mindset](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/booleans-and-conditionals/studio.html) - `this is optional`
2. Then students should read [6. Error and Debugging](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/errors-and-debugging/index.html)
3. Then students will sit for [Chapter 6 Lecture](./chapter-6-errors-and-debugging.md)
