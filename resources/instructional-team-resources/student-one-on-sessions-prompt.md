# Student One-on-One Session Prompt
I usually Preface that this is simply just time to talk with me on anything you really want. It's supposed to be time for them. If it takes an organic turn somewhere, go with it. Shoot for 10-15 min or so (might need more, might need less depending on student).


What I normally lead with:
* Ask them if there's anything they want to talk about off the bat.
  * (if not, jump to my below points)
* I don't know you. So Tell me something about you.
* How do you feel you're making out with the course?
* What are your confusion/pain points so far?
* As a Microsoft employee, What are your hopes out of this course, as you prepare for your future work?
* What are your interests relative to tech/development?
* What are your strengths/what do you feel like you're getting a solid grasp on?
* How might you use your strengths to help yourself and  other students?
* I like to hit with this at the end (you don't have to do this, I just like love to)).
* What are you interests? Outside of dev, what do you love?
* Now most importantly. What's your dream.
