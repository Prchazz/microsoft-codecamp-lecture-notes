# Chapter 1: Introduction
## Why Learn to Code?
* Ask students why they think its a good idea to learn to code?
* Give a few quick explanation of why its important to code:
  * Code is used in every part of our daily lives:
    * Cell phones
    * Self-checkouts
    * Cars (Tesla)
    * Smart devices
    * Astronaut suites (NASA Currently using Node in [suites](https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2020/02/Case_Study-Node.js-NASA.pdf))
    * etc.
  * You can make a living wage/finical freedom!
    * There is big money in the industry
  * You are able to create thing from your imagination
    * I always wanted to be an artist but can not draw or pain to save my life; coding allows me to dream up things and bring them to fruition

## Why Learn C Sharp?
* You can use it to build:
  * Web, mobile, and desktop apps
  * Games (Unity)
  * Distributed and cloud apps
    * Which makes it well rounded
* C# is designed to be easy to read and with practice it will be
  * Practice here being the key word
  * The more you build the easier it will be, this also goes for any language you learn; coding or otherwise.
* Remember by choosing engineering as a profession you are choosing a life long pursuit of knowledge
  * "You will never know more than you don't know" - Roger Campbell II

## About LaunchCode Programs
### Goals:
* Help build your problem solving skills and encourage you to learn how to learn.
  * Learning how to learn will help you continually adapt to the changing needs of your industry
* To get you ready for a career in technology and your first position with Microsoft
* We will be teaching you the skills found in a wide variety of professions and industries:
  * **Professions**: Software Engineering, DevOps, Project Management, etc
  * **Industries**: Information Technology, Automotive, Space exploration, and much much more

### Course Activities:
1. **Prep Work**: We will allocate time before each lecture for you to individual read the chapter that wil be covered
   * It is vidal that you utilize this time to read the chapter so that you are able to come to each lecture with questions on the material
   * It is recommend that you first just read the chapter then attempt to code any of the examples provided
2. **Exercises**: Small coding problems that will allow you to implement  and reinforce what was covered in the previous lecture
3. **In-class Time**: Will be broken into two sections:
   1. **Large Group Time**: AKA daily lecture(s).
      * This is time allocated for us to meet as an entire cohort and have a lecture with the Lead Instructor (Your truly! Roger Campbell II)
   2. **Small Group Time**: After daily lectures you will be broken into smaller groups which are led by your TAs
      * During this time you will work on coding activities:
        * Studios, exercises, and concept checks
4. **Assignments**: Larger project that demo what you have learned from multiple lessons

## Class Platforms
### Repl.it
* [Repl.it](https://replit.com/~) is a free online Integrated Development Environment (IDE); ie code editor
  * It provides a practice space where you can hone your programming skills
  * Repl.it serves two purposes:
    1. To provide opportunities to respond to prompts, questions, and “Try It” exercises embedded within the reading. These tasks are neither tracked nor scored.
    2. To hold larger exercises and studios that will be checked for accuracy and tracked for completion.

#### Create A Repl.it Account
* Verify students have created an account
  * If they have not remind them that this was pre-work and they should reference [Chapter 2](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/how-programs-work/hello-world.html#your-first-program) for instructions on how to create an account
* Repl.it is an online code editor for various languages. Coders collaborate by sharing repl.it URLs.
* Repl.it is used for:
  * Publicly sharing code examples and starter code
  * A place to practice new concepts by writing and running code
