    <p>Hi! My real name is Grogu. But many know me simply as "the Child." I am a male Force-sensitive Mandalorian
        foundling that belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Yaddle. I was born in the
        year 41 BBY, and was raised at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.</p>
